The CSV files stores the initial data. The column names of the initial data are as following:

| **$x_0$, $x_1$, $\dots$ $x_{n-1}$** | CPI  | Power (mW) | Area (sites) | WTS (ns) | FOM  |
| ----------------------------------- | ---- | ---------- | ------------ | -------- | ---- |

where $n$â€‹ is the number of parameters, including micro-architecture and synthesis tool parameters.

"read_init_data.py" provides a function to read the initial data into numpy arrays.
